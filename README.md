## About the Project 
Transform the educational experience with our cutting-edge project designed to revolutionize how teachers create and students interact with their textbooks. This comprehensive project aims to:

1. **Automate the Creation of Exam and Practice Questions:** Automatically generate insightful and challenging questions based on the content of any given book, including innovative questions that encourage deeper understanding and critical thinking.
2. **Extract Book Exercise Questions and Images:** Seamlessly extract exercise questions and related images from textbooks to streamline study sessions.
3. **Solve Book Questions:** Provide accurate solutions to extracted questions by leveraging the book's content.
4. **Digitize Book Content:** Bring all extracted and generated content into a convenient digital format for easy access and interaction.

By integrating advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this project will significantly reduce the workload for teachers, allowing them to focus more on teaching and less on administrative tasks, while also enhancing the learning experience for students by making it more interactive, efficient, and engaging.
