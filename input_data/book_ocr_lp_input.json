Transportation of Water in Plants\nThe structure of roots, stems and leaves of the plants helps the transport of water and minerals. Plants transport water and the minerals from its roots to the tips of the leaves.\nPlants contain a network of tubes throughout the plant. Roots have tiny threads called roots hairs. The root hairs enable the root to take in water and minerals. From root hairs water enters the tube in the root, then into the tube of the stem and then to the tubes in the leaves.\nWhat makes water move up the tube of roots, stem and leaves? You may think of the tube like a drinking straw. The bottom of the straw (tubes) is in a place where there is lots of water in the roots. There is plenty of water here because the root hairs always absorbing water from the soil. At the top of the 'straw' (tube), water is always being removed. How? The tubes in the leaves open through pores. Water evaporates through the pores. Evaporation of water vapour through the pores in the leaves is called transpiration. The movement of water in plants is driven by transpiration. Water particles are attached with one another and are also attached to the wall of the tubes. Water evaporating from the pores of the leaves of a plant causes the plant to draw up more water from the roots.\nChapter 02\n\nActivity 2.6\nTake two soft plants having white flowers, for example Petunia.
