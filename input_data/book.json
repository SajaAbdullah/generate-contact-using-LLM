Advancement in the field of science have led to many benefits manifested in increased yields of crops for human consumption, genetically modified animals, faster means of communication and transportation and more life saving drugs, to name a few. These developments have been coupled with leaps in technological advancements, which have brought communication and information to the palms of a vast majority of the population through smart phones and many other portable devices. Within this age of technological sophistication it is imperative to have learners develop understanding and conceptual clarity in science to provide a strong foundation for future learning in this field. Such an outlook is particularly important for developing nations to bringing their population at par with the trends in the global community.\n\nThis model textbook of General Science Grade 4 has been developed by NBF according to the National Curriculum of Pakistan 2022-23, in the light of standards for quality textbooks. It has been developed with the aim of providing a strong foundational base of general science concepts upon which subsequent learning of the students will be built. Offering an improved design with attractive graphics, comprehensive content and interactive elements, this textbook aims to make learning for students of grade - 4 an interesting and rewarding activity. The material has been developed with a keen eye to establishing real life links for the learners so that their education process enriches them through better conceptual understanding and the ability to apply their learning. The increased emphasis on activities and project work is for steering children away from rote memorization to developing critical thinking and analytical skills.\n\nThis textbook has been aligned with TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study). Structured Questions are included in each chapter’s exercise. These questions are internationally used to assess student’s reasoning, analyzing and problem solving skills.\n\nThe National Book Foundation is always striving for improvement in the quality of its books. The present book features an improved design, better illustration and interesting activities relating to real life to make it attractive for young learners. However, there is always room for improvement and the suggestions and feedback of students, teachers and the community are most welcome for further enriching the subsequent editions of this book.\n\nDr. Raja Mazhar Hameed\nManaging Director", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 3, "book_page_no": null, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/3.jpeg"}, {"text": "CONTENTS\n\nSr. No.\tContents\t\t\t\tPage No.\n\nLife Science\n1\tLife Processes of Plants and Animals\t01\n2\tPlants- Structure and Function\t\t12\n3\tAnimals-Structure and Function\t\t33\n4\tEcosystem - Adaption\t\t\t\t56\n\nPhysical Science\n5\tMatters and its Characteristics\t\t71\n6\tForms of Energy and Energy Transfer\t88\n7\tForce and Motion\t\t\t\t\t106\n\nEarth and Space Science\n8\tEarth, Its Resources and Atmosphere\t127\n9\tSolar System and Our Earth\t\t\t136\n10\tTechnology in Everyday Life\t\t\t149\n\nGlossary\t\t\t\t\t\t159", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 4, "book_page_no": null, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/4.jpeg"}, {"text": "Chapter 01\n\nLife Processes of Plants and Animals\n\nStudents' Learning Outcomes\nAfter studying this chapter, the students will be able to:\n1.

All living things carryout certain activities. So, these activities are the characteristics of living things. All living things take in nutrition, grow, breathe, have sensitivity, move, reproduce, eliminate waste and die.\n1. Characteristics of Living Things\nThere are eight characteristics of living things.\n\nNutrition\nAll living things need food to remain alive. Plants make their own food but animals get from other living things.\nObject: Illustration of various living things (goat, boy, mushrooms, apple tree) related to nutrition.\n\nGrowth\nGrowth is simply an increase in size. For example, you start life as a small baby. Now you are large one having increased in weight and height.\nObject: Illustration of a human growth sequence from an infant to an adult accompanied by a dog growing larger.\n\nBreathe\nAll the living things breathe. It is a process of moving air into and out of the lungs. During this process oxygen gas is absorbed and carbon dioxide gas is removed from the body.\nObject: Illustration showing a girl with flower pots introducing oxygen gas and carbon dioxide exchange signified by a flower and a dog.\n\nSensitivity\nAnimals and plants are sensitive to changes in their environment. For example, when you touch a hot object, you immediately move your hand away from it. Plants also show sensitivity e.g., there is a plant named \"touch - me - not\". When it is touched it leaves automatically fold-up.\nObject: Illustration demonstrating human hand withdrawing from a hot pan and a \"touch-me-not\" plant with leaves folding upon touch.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 7, "book_page_no": 3, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/7.jpeg"}, {"text": "Chapter 01\n\nMovement\nRaise your right arm. The muscles are working to move your right arm. Muscles provide movement in all animals. The cow, man, goat, deer etc. move with their legs. The birds and butterflies fly with their wings. Some animals like seals, move their bodies to perform movement. Snakes do not have limbs. They move their body by muscles. Fish move with their fins. Parts of plants always move slowly, e.g.,opening and closing of flower. The shoot of the plant bends towards light as they grow. All living things show movement.\nObject: Image of a deer in a field.\n\nReproduction\nAll living things produce young ones of their own kind and thus maintain the continuity of a species, e.g., frog produces new frogs. A coconut plant will produce new coconut plants and a rose plant will produce new rose plants. A rat will always produce a rat. A cat will produce kittens.\nObject: Image of a coconut tree with coconuts.\nA bird has wings, feathers, beak, legs and claws etc. A bird inherits the characters from its parents.

For example, all the animals e.g., cow, goat, horse etc. produce urine and feces which are given out of the body. Plants also produce waste such as gums and resins which are given out of the bark.\n\nDeath\nNo living things have a limitless life. Sooner are later they die. They die of diseases, old age, in accidents or eaten by other living things.\n\nActivity 1.3\nTick (\\u221a)correctly the given table.\nSr.No Characteristics A plant An animal A fallen leaf A stone\n1 Moves\n2 Grows\n3 Reproduces\n4 Requires nutrition\n5 Once moved\n6 Once grew\n7 Once reproduced\n8 Once required nutrition\n9 Never moved\n10 Never grew\n11 Never reproduced\n12 Never required nutrition\nObject: Four photographs depicting examples of elimination of waste from a cow, tree, and other examples of waste from plants and animals.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 9, "book_page_no": 5, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/9.jpeg"}, {"text": "Interesting information\nThis is a Venn diagram. Similarities are written in its centre and differences are written on its sides.\n\n2. Living Things Need Energy\nEnergy is the ability to do work. It is needed by all living things to grow, to move, to keep themselves warm and to be healthy. Plants get their energy from sunlight. They transform water, carbon dioxide and energy from sunlight into oxygen and simple sugar through the process of photosynthesis. It takes place in the green leaves. Plants use sugars as fuel to get energy.\nObject: Diagram of photosynthesis process labeled \"Water + Carbon dioxide\" on one side and \"Simple sugar + Oxygen\" on the other, with an arrow labeled \"Light\" pointing towards \"Green leaves\".\nAll the animals depend on plants for survival to get energy. Some animals eat plants directly e.g., cow, goat, horse etc. Other animals eat animals that eat the plants e.g., tiger, lion and wolf. Some animals eat plants and also other animals e.g. humans, birds, foxes and dogs.\nWe get lots of energy from food. Our bodies turn energy into other forms such as movement.\n\nInteresting information\nDuring photosynthesis water is broken down to produce oxygen.\n\n3. Needs of Plants for Life\nAlmost all plants need air, light, water, nutrients from soil and space to grow for their survival.\nAir: Air contains many gases. These include nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour. Using light energy plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose and oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis. Plants also absorb oxygen gas from the air. Plants need oxygen to respire. Respiration is process of breaking down a type of sugar (glucose) for energy.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 10, "book_page_no": 6, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/10.jpeg"}, {"text": "Light: Light is absorbed by leaves. During photosynthesis this light is used as source of energy.\n\nWater: Almost 90% of the body of a plant is water. Along with water plants absorb salts and minerals etc., from soil. Water is necessary for photosynthesis. It is also needed for transport of salts and minerals throughout the plant. Too little water can cause plant to wilt or droop.\nObject: Illustration of a \"Healthy plant\" next to a \"Wilted plant.\"\n\nNutrients from Soil: The substances that nourish a plant are called nutrients. The plants need nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. These nutrients remain dissolve in water which are absorbed by the roots.\n\nSpace to Grow: All living things need space. A plant's roots need space so that they can spread out and absorb water and nutrients. The leaves of a plant need space so that they can get light. Overcrowded plants become less healthy.\n\nObject: Heading \"Activity 1.4\" with the text \"Do plants need light and water to survive and make their own food?

Parts of Flowering Plant and their Functions\nThe five important parts of a flowering plant are root, stem, leaf, flower and seed. Each of these parts performs its particular function.\n\nRoot\nThe root is present under the ground. Its branches spread in different directions. The roots anchor plants in the soil. The roots absorb water and minerals from the soil.\n\nStem\nThe stem grows above the ground. A stem has many branches. There are, many leaves on the stem. The stem transports water and minerals from root to the leaves. It also supports the plant.\nObject: Illustration of a flowering plant, with labels for 'Root', 'Stem', 'Leaf', 'Flower', and 'Fruit'.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 20, "book_page_no": 16, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/20.jpeg"}, {"text": "\nLeaves\n\nActivity 2.5\nTake a leaf.

The first thing you usually notice in a plant, is its leaves. Leaves are of different sizes and shapes. Usually the colour of the leaves is green. One of the most important functions of the leaves is to make food for the plant.\nObject: Illustration of a leaf with labels 'Midrib', 'Vein', 'Petiole', and 'Lamina'.\n\nFlowers\nThe flowering plants have beautiful flowers, of different sizes and colours. Fruits and seeds are formed from the flowers.\nObject: Photograph of a flower.\n\n3. Transportation of Water in Plants\nThe structure of roots, stems and leaves of the plants helps the transport of water and minerals. Plants transport water and the minerals from its roots to the tips of the leaves.\nPlants contain a network of tubes throughout the plant. Roots have tiny threads called roots hairs. The root hairs enable the root to take in water and minerals. From root hairs water enters the tube in the root, then into the tube of the stem and then to the tubes in the leaves.\nWhat makes water move up the tube of roots, stem and leaves? You may think of the tube like a drinking straw. The bottom of the straw (tubes) is in a place where there is lots of water in the roots. There is plenty of water here because the root hairs always absorbing water from the soil. At the top of the 'straw' (tube), water is always being removed. How? The tubes in the leaves open through pores. Water evaporates through the pores. Evaporation of water vapour through the pores in the leaves is called transpiration. The movement of water in plants is driven by transpiration. Water particles are attached with one another and are also attached to the wall of the tubes. Water evaporating from the pores of the leaves of a plant causes the plant to draw up more water from the roots.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 21, "book_page_no": 17, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/21.jpeg"}, {"text": "Chapter 02\n\nActivity 2.6\nTake two soft plants having white flowers, for example Petunia.

Observe under the microscope and identify the differences between the two stems.\nObject: Illustration showing two glasses, one with clear water and one with red water, each containing a plant to demonstrate \"Transportation of water from roots to leaves.\"\n\nInteresting information\nThe secret to how water can move upwards is that it is pulled, not pushed. The powerful suction force generated by transpiration can pull water to the tops of plant.\n\n4. Structure of a Flower\nA flower is a very important and attractive part of the plant. In some plants there is only one flower at a stalk e.g., rose. Some flowers are produced in bunches e.g., mustard. The stalk of the flower is called pedicel. The flower has four parts at the pedicel. These occur in the form of four whorls. The four parts of flower are sepals, petals, stamens and carpel.\nObject: Diagram labeled \"Structure of a flower\" showing parts of a flower including Sepal, Petal, Stamen (Anther, Filament), Carpel (Stigma, Style, Ovary), Ovule, and Pedicel.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 22, "book_page_no": 18, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/22.jpeg"}, {"text": "Chapter 02\nPlants-Structure and Function\n\nNo.\tName\tCharacteristics\tFunctions\n1\tSepals\tThese are green leaflets.

Sexual Reproduction in Plants\nIn flowering plants, sexual reproduction takes place through flowers. As a result of pollination, the pollen grain reaches the stigma. Here, it forms a thin tube in the style called pollen tube. After passing through the style, pollen tube reaches the ovary. Then it enters the ovule.\nMale gametes are formed in the pollen tube and female gametes are formed in the ovule. The male and female gametes fuse to form a zygote which is called fertilization. The zygote divides many times to form the embryo. Then the ovule becomes seed and ovary ripens to form the fruit.\nObject: Illustration of the process of sexual reproduction in plants with labels \"Pollen grain, Stigma, Style, Pollen tube, Ovary, Ovule, Female gamete, Male gamete, and Sexual reproduction in plant.\"\n\n7. Structure of Seed\nThe outer covering of a seed is called seed coat. It protects the tiny embryo which is present inside seed. There is a pore on seed coat. It is called micropyle. Embryo consists of cotyledons, which store food. The axis of embryo is between the two cotyledons. The first part that comes out of the seeds is called radicle. When seed germinates, its radicle forms roots. The other end of the axis is called plumule.

They have an internal skeleton made of bones. Their body is divided into three main parts: head, abdomen and tail. The brain is present within the skull. They have great ability to hear, see, smell, taste and feel. The blood circulates in the blood vessels of the body. The skin of vertebrates is covered with scales, feathers and hair of different groups.\nVarious types of invertebrates are found on the Earth. The invertebrates are animals with no backbone. The body structure of invertebrates is of different types. Some are flat, some are round and some are segmented. The body parts of invertebrates are different in different groups.\n\nClassification of Vertebrates\nThe vertebrates are divided into five groups i.e., fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\n\ni. Fish\nFish live in water. Most fish have streamlined bodies. The streamlined body is one that tappers at both ends. The head and tails are smaller and more pointed than the middle part of the fish. Most fish have scales which cover and protect their bodies. Most fish breathe through gills.\nFish have fins and tails which help them to swim. Reproduction in fish takes place through eggs.

Think about the food you are taking in the breakfast. It may be bread, egg and milk. Can the egg enter your body cells? Before your cells can use the nutrients in the egg or any food, they must be broken down.\nThe different body parts that are involved in the process of digestion make up the digestive system. The organs of the digestive system are the mouth, esophagus stomach, small intestine and large intestine. The liver, gall bladder and pancreas also help in the process of digestion.\n\nMouth\nDigestion of food starts in the mouth. Food is broken down into smaller pieces by the action of teeth.

The five major groups of invertebrates are jellyfish, corals, earthworm, insects and snails.\n6. Some animals have an exoskeleton e.g., earthworm, insects and snails.\n7. Some animals have an endoskeleton e.g., cow, goat, horse.\n8. The organs of human digestive system are mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.\n9. In mouth food is chewed and mixed with saliva.\n10. Esophagus is a narrow tube. In esophagus no digestion of food takes places.\n11. Stomach is a large organ. Its walls secrete juice, which digest the food. Here the food becomes semifluid.\n12. Small intestine receives secretions from liver and pancreas which digest the food. The digested food is absorbed by finger like projections. The digest food particles are transported to all parts of the body through the blood. The process of digestion is completed in the small intestine.\n13. In large intestine excess of water and minerals are absorbed. The feces is stored in the rectum and given out of the body through the anus.\n14. The five types of teeth are: incisors, canines, premolars and molars. They perform particular functions.\n15. The two important diseases of teeth are tooth decay and gum diseases.\n16. Many vertebrates have a digestive system similar to humans e.g., chimpanzees, gorilla, horse, cat etc.\n17.

With the increase in population, we will need more houses, schools, roads, commercial areas, factories etc. The concentration of people in certain area is called urbanization. For this forests and agricultural land have to be cleared. These human action destroys the habitats. With the urbanization the habitats of many animals and plants are reduced.\n\nPopulation growth and urbanization are human contribution to habitats destruction. The habitats continue to disappear due to increase in human population and urbanization. With the loss of habitats wildlife of the habitats is also lost.\n\n5. Changes in a habitat affect the organisms living there\nClimate change can cause shifts in the habitats of organisms. It also changes in the species composition of a given ecosystem. For example, as temperatures rise, some species may be better adapted to survive than others. It results in changes in the abundance of different species. Global warming affects many processes in biological ecosystems. For example insects in terrestrial areas and fish and arthropods in the seas and oceans, change. If bird's habitats change, so migrations of some birds may also be modified.\n\nClimate change also alters the life cycles of plants and animals. For example, as temperature increases many plants start to grow. They bloom earlier in the spring and survive longer into the fall. Some animals are waking from hibernation sooner or migrating at different times", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 70, "book_page_no": 66, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/70.jpeg"}, {"text": "Chapter 04\n\nKey Points\n\n1. Ecosystem is an environment where plants and animals naturally live.\n2. The example of ecosystem are: forests, ponds, rivers, grasslands and deserts.\n3. Habitat is the place where an organism lives.\n4. Adaptations are characteristics of organisms that enable them to survive in their habitat.\n5. Desert plants adaptation include: leaves, stems are thick coated with thick waxy layer, roots grow deep into soil.\n6. Desert animals adaptation include; some animals awake at night, some lives in burrow, some have light coloured body to reflect light. They have adaptations to reduce water loss. Colours of animals help in camouflage.\n7. Desert animals include coyotes, bobcats, spiders, scorpions, rattle snakes, lizard, camel and many kinds of birds.\n8. A micro habitat is a small area which differs some how from he surrounding habitat.\n9. Adaptations of plants living in water include: leaves and flowers float in water. Leaves and stems are coated with waxy layer. Have air spaces inside the stem and leaves adapted for floating.\n10. Adaptations in animals that live in water are: Fish have streamlined bodies and fins to help them swim in water. Frogs, ducks etc. have webbed feet to help them move easily in water. Seals and sea turtles have flippers to help them move easily in water.\n11. Animal migration is the large scale movement of animals from one place to another, usually on a season basis.\n12. Animals migrate to survive. It is a form of adaptation. It is difficult to survive in all the year in extreme climatic conditions.\n13. Some birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects migrate.\n14. Hibernation is a way animals conserve energy to survive adverse weather conditions on lack of food.\n15. Urbanization causes, habitat loss due to increase in roads and building. As a result the plants and animals of that habitat is lost.", "page_type": "normal_page", "pdf_page_no": 71, "book_page_no": 67, "pdf_page_image_url": "https://lmsreborn-bookmapping-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/book_images/General+Science+4+(Hyper+Specific)_0624074a-a493-4e48-8313-746cf0ad4d8d/71.jpeg"}, {"text": "\nKey Vocabulary\nadaptation adapted botanists conditions desert ecologist environment forest grasslands habitat hibernation migration non-living pond resources river survive zoo keepers zoology\n\nWeblinks: Use the following weblinks to enhance your knowledge about the topics in this chapter.\n1. adaptation https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/adaptation/\n2. migration https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration\n3. hibernation https://www.science.org.au/curious/hibernation\n\nExercises\n1.
